//This is a README for the Nexus ResQ repo. This entire repo is dedicated 
to creating an online PC webpage for all users and roles to (check status
of inspections, track assets, view failed assets, view/print/export 
complete inspection logs with results. All inspections are timestamped 
and signed. The webpage is for PC use but users can use mobile if they
would like. The actual scanning and inspecting portion of Nexus ResQ is 
to be done on a Bartec Rugged Intrinsically safe laser scanner running 
the latest Android firmware. Unless otherwise notated in this file. This 
repo is a work in progress. Our goal here is to create a groundbreaking, 
blazing fast, and superior tracking system when compared to our competitors. 
We are 99% targeted to Industrial Refineries such as Exxon, BP, Chevron, 
Citgo, etc. All petrochemical and poly companies like Dow, DuPont, or Westlake 
Chemical are target clients as well. This project utilizes Firebase for its 
backend. Please ensure any iterations generated by ChatGPT or Claude Sonnet 4 
in VS are connecting to Firebase unless otherwise specified. Check backend 
rules to ensure proper modification/addition/removal of data is done in the 
correct and appropriate manner. Precision is KEY here. 

Location system: Focal point increases by Level. at level0: most broad, general area. 
level1: a building, a unit, a block, etc. level2: a precise spot inside the building, unit, or block. 
Each level should have a 3-4 character code tied to it. If the client wants level2 locating. Then 
there will be a location barcode at the exact spot the asset is. EXAMPLE:: level0: Zone 3. code:(359). 
level1: G Unit. code: (883). level2: NW alleyway. code: (7485).  locationId/Barcode to be scanned at 
the asset: 3598837485. This tells the scanner, user, and Admin. Where EXACTLY something is. Not all clients
may care about this. But its a key part of our business if they do. We need to be able to generate these codes
if the client does not already have them. These codes can be tied together in any number of ways. Zone 3, but 
C Unit. might be EXAMPLE:::(359741) and then level2 would be a 4 digit number specified or generated. 

The assets get scanned, questions get answered depending on the type of inspection being done. The inspection is logged 
and the user moves on to the next asset. When the user is done scanning and inspecting. The results are compiled and converted to a 
table pdf and stored for instant recall on the dashboard and able to be printed/exported. They need to be able to be queried in any number 
of ways. By User, By Date, By Area/Zone/Unit etc, By Manager, by Asset type.   This needs to be extremely precise, and log/timestamp
all actions. Our goal is total compliance, and giving the Admin the tools they need to modify their site, to what they need.
