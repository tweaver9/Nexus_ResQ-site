//This is a README for the Nexus ResQ repo. This entire repo is dedicated to creating an online PC webpage for all users and roles to (check status of inspections, track assets, view failed assets, view/print/export complete inspection logs with results. All inspections are timestamped and signed. The webpage is for PC use but users can use mobile if they would like. The actual scanning and inspecting portion of Nexus ResQ is to be done on a Bartec Rugged Intrinsically safe laser scanner running the latest Android firmware. Unless otherwise notated in this file. This repo is a work in progress. Our goal here is to create a groundbreaking, blazing fast, and superior tracking system when compared to our competitors. We are 99% targeted to Industrial Refineries such as Exxon, BP, Chevron, Citgo, etc. All petrochemical and poly companies like Dow, DuPont, or Westlake Chemical are target clients as well. This project utilizes Firebase for its backend. Please ensure any iterations generated by ChatGPT or Claude Sonnet 4 in VS are connecting to Firebase unless otherwise specified. Check backend rules to ensure proper modification/addition/removal of data is done in the correct and appropriate manner. Precision is KEY here.
