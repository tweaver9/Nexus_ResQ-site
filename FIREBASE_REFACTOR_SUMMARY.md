# Nexus Res-Q Firebase Structure Refactor - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the Nexus Res-Q platform to implement a multi-tenant Firebase structure where each client has dedicated collections under `/clients/{clientSubdomain}/`.

## New Firebase Structure

### Root Collections (Global/Default)
- `asset_types` - Global asset type templates (fallback)
- `questionTemplates` - Global question templates (fallback)

### Client-Specific Collections
Each client has their own folder at `/clients/{clientSubdomain}/` containing:
- `assets/` - Client-specific assets
- `assignments/` - Client-specific assignments  
- `inspectionRecords/` - Client-specific inspection records
- `locations/` - Client-specific locations
- `users/` - Client-specific users
- `logs/` - Client-specific logs
- `asset_types/` - Client-specific asset types (optional)
- `questionTemplates/` - Client-specific question templates (optional)

### Client Root Document
Each client has a root document at `/clients/{clientSubdomain}` containing:
```javascript
{
  name: "Client Name",
  logo_url: "https://...",
  subdomain: "clientsubdomain",
  settings: {
    barcodeDelimiter: "-",
    barcodeLevels: ["zone", "sublocation", "precisionlocation"],
    preciseScanEnabled: true,
    reportFormat: "pdf",
    typingAllowed: true,
    mapDivisions: ["Zone 1", "Zone 2"],
    customAssetTypes: false,
    customQuestions: false
  },
  createdAt: "2025-01-10T...",
  status: "active",
  onboarding_completed: true
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. firebase.js - Enhanced with Utility Functions
- Added client-specific path generation functions
- Implemented fallback logic for asset types and question templates
- Added session management utilities
- Created validation functions

Key functions added:
- `getCurrentClientSubdomain()`
- `getClientCollection(subdomain, collectionName)`
- `getClientDoc(subdomain, collectionName, docId)`
- `loadAssetTypesWithFallback(subdomain)`
- `loadQuestionTemplatesWithFallback(subdomain)`
- `getClientSettings(subdomain)`

### 2. onboard.html - Complete Onboarding Refactor
- Updated to create proper client structure
- Creates client-specific collections with placeholder documents
- Stores admin user in client-specific users collection
- Implements proper settings structure
- Creates locations with UUIDs during onboarding

### 3. login.js - Enhanced Authentication
- Added client validation before login
- Enhanced session storage with client context
- Loads and stores client settings
- Improved error handling

### 4. manage-assets.js - Client-Specific Asset Management
- Refactored to use client-specific asset collections
- Updated asset type loading with fallback logic
- Modified all CRUD operations to use client paths
- Enhanced caching with client-specific keys

### 5. dashboard.js - Modernized and Client-Aware
- Converted from compat to modular Firebase API
- Updated data loading to use client-specific collections
- Enhanced with proper error handling
- Improved client context management

### 6. view-inspections.js - Client-Specific Inspections
- Updated to use client-specific inspection records
- Modified area and asset type loading
- Enhanced with proper data isolation

### 7. location-hierarchy.html - Updated Placeholders
- Changed placeholder document ID from 'starter' to '_placeholder'
- Maintains compatibility with existing location management

## Fallback Logic Implementation

### Asset Types
1. First checks `/clients/{subdomain}/asset_types`
2. If empty, falls back to global `/asset_types`
3. If still empty, uses default categories

### Question Templates  
1. First checks `/clients/{subdomain}/questionTemplates`
2. If empty, falls back to global `/questionTemplates`
3. Graceful degradation if none found

## Session Management Updates

Enhanced session storage includes:
- `tenant_id` / `clientSubdomain` - Client identifier
- `clientSettings` - Client-specific settings JSON
- `clientLogoUrl` - Client logo URL
- `clientName` - Client display name
- Standard user session data (username, role, etc.)

## Onboarding Process

The new onboarding creates:
1. Client root document with comprehensive settings
2. Admin user in client-specific users collection
3. Locations with generated UUIDs
4. Empty collections with placeholder documents:
   - `assets/_placeholder`
   - `assignments/_placeholder` 
   - `inspectionRecords/_placeholder`
5. Initial log entry in `logs/onboarding`
6. Optional client-specific asset types and question templates

## Data Isolation

- All client data is completely isolated under their subdomain path
- No cross-client data access possible
- Proper tenant validation on all operations
- Session-based client context enforcement

## Backward Compatibility

- Maintains existing API endpoints
- Preserves existing data structures where possible
- Graceful fallback to global collections
- Placeholder documents prevent collection deletion

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test onboarding flow with new client creation
2. Verify asset management with client-specific data
3. Test inspection recording and viewing
4. Validate user management within client context
5. Confirm fallback logic for asset types and templates
6. Test location hierarchy management
7. Verify dashboard data loading

## Enhanced Features Implemented

### Intelligent Onboarding System
- **Map Division Flow**: Smart selection between standard types (Zone, Building, Unit, Area, Control Room) and custom divisions
- **Custom Division Support**: Dynamic input generation for custom division names and codes
- **Division Labels**: Ability to customize what each level is called (e.g., "Area" instead of "Zone")
- **Barcode Configuration**: Configurable delimiter and level structure
- **Settings Integration**: Comprehensive settings object with all onboarding preferences

### Default Locations System
- **Required Default Locations**: Every client gets three essential locations:
  - `Newly Added` (code: 001) - Default location for new assets
  - `Out of Service` (code: 002) - For assets that are out of service
  - `Offsite` (code: 000) - For assets that are offsite
- **Full Hierarchy**: Each default location includes sublocation and precision location levels
- **Asset Lifecycle**: New assets automatically start in "Newly Added" and move when scanned

### Live Data Integration
- **Dashboard**: Removed all demo data, now shows only live Firestore data
- **Asset Management**: Updated to 4 cards per row, removed bulk add button
- **User Management**: Confirmed 4 cards per row layout
- **Inspections Page**: Complete new page replacing billing with table view, filters, and PDF links

### Enhanced Client Settings
```javascript
settings: {
  barcodeDelimiter: "-",
  barcodeLevels: ["zone", "sublocation", "precisionlocation"],
  preciseScanEnabled: true,
  reportFormat: "pdf",
  typingAllowed: true,
  mapDivisions: ["Zone 1", "Zone 2"],
  mapDivisionType: "Zone",
  mapDivisionLabels: {"Zone": "Area"},
  mapDivisionCodes: ["001", "002"],
  customAssetTypes: false,
  customQuestions: false
}
```

## Asset Lifecycle Management

### New Asset Flow
1. **Creation**: All new assets start in "Newly Added" location
2. **Scanning**: When scanned to a new location, asset moves from "Newly Added"
3. **Service States**: Assets can be moved to "Out of Service" or "Offsite" as needed
4. **Location Tracking**: Full hierarchy tracking (location → sublocation → precision)

### Barcode Integration
- Configurable delimiter between location codes
- Support for custom division codes from onboarding
- Three-level hierarchy support (zone, sublocation, precision)

### Key Test Areas
1. Onboarding flow with custom divisions
2. Default location creation and asset lifecycle
3. Live data loading across all pages
4. Multi-tenant data isolation
5. Fallback logic for asset types and question templates

## Next Steps

2. **PDF Generation**: Implement PDF download for inspection records
3. **Asset Scanning**: Integrate barcode scanning with location updates
4. **Data Migration**: Migrate existing clients to new structure if needed
